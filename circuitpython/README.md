# Introduction to Circuit Python and the Circuit Playground Express

This is the entry point for my workshop on working with the [Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview).

## Overview

Welcome to the **Introduction to the [Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview) Workshop**. Participants are expected to walk away with enough knowledge to be able to use and program thier Circuit Playground Express or other similar [circuitpython]#TODO boards. The workshop has a mixture of hands-on exercises and lecture/demos, with the focus on hands-on activities.

### What to expect

This workshop covers...


* [Installing software](./installing_tools.md): basic installation of the tools you need to code the CPX board
* [Writing Programs](./example_01.md): source code and full descriptions of several programs that demonstrate use of many of the inputs and outputs on the board, including the buttons, switch, capacitive touch sensors, thermometer, light sensor, and NeoPixels


### What not to expect

This workshop does **not** cover...

* Advanced programming techniques
* Hands-on hooking up external hardware

There are many languages you can use to program the CPX board, but this class is specifically limited to Python.
