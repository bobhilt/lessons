## Time Box

15 minutes


## Overview

The first task with your new board is to install [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython) on it (it comes with [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) out of the box).


## What to Do

1. [Download CircuitPython for the Circuit Playground Express](https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_express/) and save it locally to wherever you usually save downloads.

1. Plug your CPX board into your computer (make sure you can see it as a mounted drive)
1. Find the reset button on your board... it's right in the middle
1. Press the reset button twice in a row
1. Your computer should now show a drive called `CPLAYBOOT`
1. Drag the file you downloaded onto the `CPLAYBOOT` drive
1. Watch as a couple lights flash and the board re-mounts as `CIRCUITPY`

## Discussion

The board comes with `micropython` installed, which requires all kinds of tools and extra learning to really get up and running. You're here because you want to use `circuitpython`!

One nice thing about the AdaFruit boards is that they are designed to make this upgrade easy. Any time you want to reset your board or want the latest version of `circuitpython`, just follow the steps above.
