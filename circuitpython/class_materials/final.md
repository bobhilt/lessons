## Overview

I hope you've enjoyed learing your way around the Circuit Playground Express! Because it's a very easy board to work with and because Python is such an intuitive language for this kind of thing, we managed to cover a lot of ground!


## Feedback

Please take a moment to give the instructor some feedback!

On your **green** sticky, please write one or two things you think were the highlights of this workshop.

On your **red** sticky, please write one or two things you think could have been improved in this workshop.

When you have done so, please give them to the instructor :)

## Next Steps

While we have explored the CPX board quite a bit, there are still many things we have not covered:

* microphone
* speaker
* infrared transmitter and receiver
* digital and analog inputs and outputs
* peripherals (mouse, keyboard, etc)

My suggestion for learning your way around the board is to pick a sensor, invent a way to visualize that sensor, and write it! You probably noticed similar patterns for many of the programs here, use those same patterns with new sensors to better follow what's going on.


## Experience Points

Here are some ideas for programs you should be able to write (though they might not be as simple) based on what you've learned today:

* An acceleration meter that lights a number of pixels representing the total amount of acceleration on the device
* A meter that represents *change in* temperature or light, where five pixels means not changing and more or fewer pixels represents the rate of change of the measurement
* A game where you light pixels sequentially from one side to the other, and each player has to hit their button (a or b) to "hit" the pixel back to the other player (so Pong in 1 dimension)

And here are some ideas for programs you should be able to figure out using the online documentation:

* Iron Man's heart: the display should be straightforward, but you can also sew the CPX into clothing!
* A communicator: send a secret message from one device to another using infrared
* A sound to light meter: use pixels to indicate volume or frequency around the device
* ... and a million more!

Most of all, stay curious!
