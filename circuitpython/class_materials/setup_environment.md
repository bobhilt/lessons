## Overview

In this section we will set up Visual Studio Code (and talk about other editors you can use instead) and connect to the CPX for the first time.


## Editors

### Editor vs IDE

What is an IDE? That stands for Integrated Development Environment, and it means a program that gives you lots of tooling and functionality related to writing code. While an IDE and an editor can look a lot alike, there are some fundamental differences that you should be familiar with:

* IDEs usually have debugging and analysis tools built-in
* IDEs typically are specific to one language (or a small set of related languages)
* IDEs often are *monolithic*, meaning they are large programs that try to do a lot of things

In the early days of writing software, IDEs didn't exist. That changed with the advent of GUI-based operating systems (like the original Mac OS and Windows 95), when suddenly it was possible to put all the tooling and functionality that a developer needed into a single program with a well-defined idea about how software should be written, built, tested/debugged, and deployed.

If you've used any of the following, you've used an IDE:

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (by far the most famous/infamous)
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Mu](https://codewith.mu/)

Over the years, IDEs have become much more powerful and feature-rich ... but at a cost. IDEs generally take much longer to start than a simple editor
