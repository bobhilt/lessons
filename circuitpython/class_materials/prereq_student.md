## Time-box

N/A: these preparatory steps should be completed prior to the start of the course.


## Overview

This section is intended for the workshop **student**. It outlines what students should do to get the most out of the workshop.

This workshop is not targeted for advanced programmers, but a certain familiarity with basic programming concepts is assumed. In most exercises, the student *should* be able to follow the exercise even if the details of the code are not fully grasped. If you need help understanding any program, ask questions of the instructor or the people around you.

The following soft skills will help with successfully completing this workshop:

* a desire to learn and experiment
* a basic understanding of the operation of a computer
* a basic understanding of what programming is


## What to do

### Learning methods

The workshop is about three hours and covers a lot of material. Anything you can do to optimize your learning experience will be beneficial. Below are just some suggestions:

* Ask questions. Lots of questions
    * Take advantage of the fact that you are in a room with mentors to get your questions answered
    * If you are nervous about asking a question in public: put up your red post-it to let a mentor know you are struggling... they will come to help
* It will be recommended that you partner with someone... if you are comfortable with this, please take advantage of the chance to work with someone; experience shows that both parties tend to benefit from this arrangement
* Participate as much as you can, do the hands-on exercises, try the steps
* Take notes


### Using the command line

In the hands-on practice session, you will be using command-line tools interact with your CPX board. If you don't feel comfortable with the command-line yet, see the Resources below for cheatsheets and references to a number of the most common commands.
